C program to be simplified and developed.
Text entered from the terminal gets written to text file data.txt, along with current line number.
When a blank line is entered the program stops.

The line number should be handled locally in the print function. The file content is also supposed to be read line by line and printed in the terminal
before the program terminates. The student is to make these modifications.
